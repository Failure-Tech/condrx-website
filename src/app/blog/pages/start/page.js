                <h1 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Welcome to Condrx</h1>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    We&apos;re a small R&D firm with big ambitions—on a mission to build tools that solve the hardest problems in AI, security, and finance. We believe innovation doesn’t come from following trends. It comes from rethinking systems, asking deeper questions, and shipping with care.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    Condrx was started by a group of builders who wanted to do things differently. We don’t just write code—we build systems, explore research, and chase ideas worth grinding for. The goal? To take the breakthroughs happening in papers, labs, and open-source—and turn them into real-world, user-first products.
                </p>

                <h1 className="text-2xl font-semibold">What We’re About</h1>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    We’re part product studio, part research team. Whether we’re prototyping fintech safety layers, building autonomous agents for analysts, or designing interfaces that make LLMs usable by default—our goal is the same: bring clarity to complexity.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    Our work blends R&D with product rigor. Everything we build is grounded in real technical depth, whether it’s based on a research paper, a problem we’ve felt firsthand, or something one of our collaborators dreamed up on a whiteboard at 2AM.
                </p>

                <h1 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Why We Exist</h1>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    The world is changing fast, but too much of the new tech is being built without thought for its impact—or without tools that make it safe and usable for everyone. Condrx exists to shift that. We want to build technology that doesn’t just move fast, but moves in the right direction.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    We’re here to work on the hard stuff. Not the next To-Do app—but the infrastructure that will support the next generation of builders, researchers, and companies pushing what’s possible.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg">
                    Whether you&apos;re a researcher, developer, startup, or just curious—thanks for being here. We’re excited for what’s ahead.
                </p>
