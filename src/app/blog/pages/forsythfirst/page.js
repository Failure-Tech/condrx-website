                <h1 className="text-2xl font-semibold">What is Forsyth First?</h1>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    <strong>Forsyth First</strong> is our way of empowering developers—not just with tools, but with time, space, and guidance to build what matters.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    It’s a build sprint meets workshop, designed to help small teams and solo developers go from zero to shipping with <strong>Kairo</strong>—our secure-by-default coding assistant—at the center of the process.
                </p>

                <h1 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Why We Started It</h1>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    We saw a gap. Too many developers are expected to "just know" how to integrate AI tooling into their workflows. Security is often left for later, and most hackathons prioritize speed over sustainability or robustness.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    Forsyth First flips that script. It gives developers early access to Kairo, technical guidance, and a protected environment to experiment with fast iteration and secure practices—without the pressure of “getting it perfect.”
                </p>

                <h1 className="text-2xl font-semibold">How It Works</h1>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    Each Forsyth First cohort begins with a hands-on workshop. We walk through how Kairo works under the hood, best practices for integrating it into modern web stacks, and show real examples of security-first features in action.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    Then, teams enter the sprint phase—spending 48 hours building a project of their choice using Kairo. Throughout the sprint, our engineers and researchers are available for feedback, debugging, and deep dives into Kairo’s capabilities.
                </p>

                <h1 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Kairo at the Core</h1>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    The real power of Forsyth First is getting to see how Kairo works in a real-world, creative environment. Developers learn not just how to write secure code—but how to build with flow, stay in the zone, and let Kairo handle the grunt work.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    From autocompleting secure API patterns to flagging bad habits early, Kairo becomes a silent partner in the room. And by the end of the sprint, participants walk away not only with a demo—but a deeper understanding of what secure-by-default development feels like.
                </p>

                <h1 className="text-2xl font-semibold">What’s Next</h1>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    Forsyth First isn’t a one-off. We’re scaling it to more campuses, communities, and companies. Our goal is to make secure development intuitive, accessible, and exciting—especially for those building in small teams or on their own.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    Because we believe that giving smart people the right tools and a focused runway leads to breakthroughs—not just projects.
